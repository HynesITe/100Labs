# 100Labs

This repository contains files that support labs created as part of the HynesITe 100 Labs project. Typical files that are contained in  this repo include ARM templates that are used to deploy lab solutions, PowerShell or Azure CLI automation scripts, or any other files that are needed either to configure a lab environment or perform steps in individual labs. 

Only labs that require an external source for supporting files are represented in this repo. Typically, each lab requiring external files will have a separate folder. However, labs that have files in common will use a shared folder.
